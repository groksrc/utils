# groksrc/utils

This is a simple ubuntu container that has a few commonly used programs.

It sets up tzdata first because postgresql requires it and configures America/Chicago.

Tools:
* curl
* dnsutils
* git
* hasura (with autocomplete via Oh-my-zsh)
* iputils-ping
* net-tools
* postgresql
* wget
* zsh (with Oh-my-zsh)
* vim
